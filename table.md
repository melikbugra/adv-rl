| **Results/Findings**                 | – Improved protagonist success rate and robustness to unseen start states (expected, since it trains on worst-cases plus uncertainties). *[Our results TBD in thesis]*. | – ARL protagonist outperformed non-ARL in generalizing to different initial states. Adversary automatically learned to set up challenging states (both sim and real robot). | – Robust policies that could handle perturbations; outperformed domain randomization; adversary’s presence improved training stability too. | – Protagonist learned safer driving policies; adversary uncovered edge cases (like slick patches) more efficiently than random perturbations. Ensemble-based variance helped quantify risk. | – Protagonist achieved higher **zero-shot transfer** performance on unseen test envs compared to domain randomization. Emergent curriculum of increasing complexity in levels. | – Agents trained with ASP learned much faster on downstream tasks than those without (due to having mastered environment dynamics). Showed that unsupervised self-play can replace a lot of task-specific training. | – Demonstrated that maximizing model disagreement yields efficient exploration, succeeding in stochastic games where other methods failed. No extrinsic reward needed for learning meaningful behaviors. | – Showed that pure curiosity can lead to decent performance on many games. Also identified that random feature targets (RND) work better than learned features in some cases for generalization. | – Able to generate a sequence of goals that gradually stretched the agent’s ability (e.g., push object slightly further each time), outperforming naive curriculum. GAN avoided generating trivial or impossible goals by design. | – Achieved **state-of-the-art sample efficiency** on continuous control; using 10 Q-networks and aggressive updates, results rivaled model-based methods. Validated that larger ensembles + UCB exploration can greatly speed up learning. Robustness to hyperparameters also improved. |
